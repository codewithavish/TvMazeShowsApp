TvMazeApp:
TvMazeApp is a simple Android application designed for learning purposes, focusing on implementing Dependency Injection with Hilt, coroutines, Retrofit, and MVVM architecture. It utilizes the TVMaze API to display TV show information.

Features:
Displays a list of TV shows retrieved from the TVMaze API.
Allows users to view details of each TV show.
Implements Dependency Injection using Hilt for cleaner and more maintainable code.
Utilizes coroutines for managing asynchronous tasks efficiently.
Adheres to MVVM architecture for separation of concerns and better code organization.
Retrieves TV show information from the TVMaze API using Retrofit.

Dependencies:
Hilt: Hilt is used for Dependency Injection, making it easier to manage dependencies and maintain a clean codebase.
Retrofit: Retrofit is used for making HTTP requests to the TVMaze API and handling network operations.
Coroutines: Coroutines are used for managing asynchronous tasks, ensuring smooth UI interactions and efficient background operations.
MVVM Architecture: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern, separating concerns and making the codebase more modular and easier to maintain.

How to Use:
Clone the repository from GitHub link.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.
Explore the list of TV shows and their details.

Additional Notes:
Ensure that you have an active internet connection to fetch TV show data from the TVMaze API.
Feel free to experiment and modify the code to enhance your understanding of Dependency Injection, coroutines, Retrofit, and MVVM architecture.
For more details on each component and its implementation, refer to the source code comments and documentation within the project.
